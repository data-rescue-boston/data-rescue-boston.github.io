<h2><i class="fa fa-user-plus" aria-hidden="true"></i> Get Involved</h2>

<p>The best way to get involved is to join us at one of our events. You'll meet tons of motivated, science-loving individuals from diverse backgrounds who want to ensure continued public access to data. We need people with all backgrounds and experience; whether you're an expert researcher leading your field, or an average citizen trying to figure out how to help, we'll have ways that you can support the cause.</p>

<p>Don't be intimidated if you don't have a technical background. In fact, we especially need writers and artists to help document and communicate our efforts!</p>
