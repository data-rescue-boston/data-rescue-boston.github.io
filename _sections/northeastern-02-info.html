<h2>Event Info</h2>

<p>Bring: Laptops. Food and drinks provided</p>
<p>Folks of all backgrounds and skill levels are welcome to join. We’re calling on all scientists, data nerds, artists, journalists, librarian, programmers, engineers, advocates, educators, policy-makers and more to imagine alternative forms of climate governance.</p>
<h3>Track Overviews:</h3>
<p><strong>Surveying:</strong> Surveyors research federal departments and affiliated agencies and programs to map the departments. Participants will be supported by volunteer coordinators to write agency primers.</p>
<p><strong>Seeding:</strong> Seeders build off of primers written by the Surveys to systematically explore through all websites associated with a federal department.</p>
<p><strong>Harvesting:</strong> In partnership with domain and technical experts, harvesters will take the web pages classified by seeders as needing special attention, and figure out ways to download and compile that data.</p>
<p><strong>Bagging:</strong> In this track, participants will ensure that the datasets are reasonably complete with appropriate metadata and context. The reviewed datasets will be uploaded to the appropriate live destination repositories.</p>
<p><strong>Storytelling:</strong> In this track, participants will document the event and its attendees, make signs, and hold discussions to tackle the following questions:</p>
<ul><li>What are the best ways to safeguard environmental data?</li>
<li>What art and messaging compels the public to care about environmental stewardship and unifies climate protectors?</li>
<li>How do government priorities impact data’s accessibility?</li>
<li>How might we enable new forms of participatory storytelling on the impact of the environment?</li>
<li>Which projects and research fields depend on federal data?</li>
<li>Which data sets are of value to research and local communities, and why?</li>
</ul>
