<h2><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i> About the event</h2>

<p>DataRescue at MIT is a hackathon focused on identifying, downloading, processing, and mirroring federal research data at risk of being taken down or obscured by the current administration. The event is being hosted by MIT ACSES, MIT Libraries, and EDGI.</p>

<p>People with all levels of technical background are welcome. There will be a wide array of tasks including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Browsing websites to identify data sets</li>
<li>Developing scripts and tools to scrape data</li>
<li>Processing and verifying data integrity</li>
<li>Uploading data to mirrors</li>
<li>Visualizing and documenting our efforts</li>
</ul>

<p>This event is part of a larger <a href="{{ "/" | relative_url }}">DataRescue Boston</a> movement, which includes events and collaborators at Harvard, Tufts, and Northeastern, which is in turn part of a larger national DataRescue movement organized by EDGI and UPenn's Program in the Environmental Humanities.</p>
