<p class="lead">Thanks to everyone for attending and contributing to DataRescue at MIT this past weekend! </p>
<img class="photo-wide" src="{{ "/assets/photos/harvest-wide-announce.jpg" | relative_url }}"/>
<p class="lead"> With your help, we were able to achieve:</p>

<h3>We seeded and harvested a lot of websites</h3>
<p><img class="photo" src="{{ "/assets/photos/harvest-table.jpg" | relative_url }}"/> Our work covered websites and data sets in DOE, EPA, NASA, DOI, and NOAA:</p>
<ul>
<li>~80,000 URLs seeded </li>
<ul>
<li>3300 at the event</li>
<li>Over 76,000 from attendees who contacted us after the event</li>
</ul>
<li>200 Data set URLs researched</li>
<li>53 Data sets harvested (35 GiB data)</li>
</ul>
<p>This work helps us ensure that climate data is comprehensively collected, mirrored, and accessible to everyone.</p>

<h3>We expanded the DataRescue efforts beyond climate data</h3>
<img class="photo-wide" src="{{ "/assets/photos/surveyors.jpg" | relative_url }}"/>
<p>We also piloted the Surveying track to expand the DataRescue efforts to cover non-environmental data. Our surveying team was able to write and additional 5 Main Agency Primers and 16 Sub-Agency Primers covering:</p>
<ul>
<li>Department of Justice</li>
<li>Department of Labor </li>
<li>Department of Health and Human Services</li>
<li>Department of Housing and Urban Development</li>
<li>Federal Communications Commission</li>
</ul>
<p>Writing primers is the first step in the DataRescue process, and the work done by the surveyors at our event allows us to begin rescuing important non-climate-related data!</p>

<h3>We collected data stories</h3>
<p>We wanted to learn about our diverse set of attendees: why they came to the event, why was data important to them, what were they concerned about, what do they want to see happen? </p>
<img class="photo-wide" src="{{ "/assets/photos/all-ages.jpg" | relative_url }}"/>
<p>Our storytelling team compiled a set of in-depth profiles covering the following data sets and the people who rely on them:</p>
<ul><li>National Water Information System (USGS)</li>
<li>Alternative Fuels Data Center (DOE)</li>
<li>Global Historical Climate Network (NOAA)</li>
</ul>
<p>We will be publishing these profiles in the coming weeks; we hope that they help illuminate how these data sets are used to better understand our world and make decisions that impact our everyday lives.</p>

<h2>Moving forward:</h2>
<p class="lead">We were astounded by the unique combination of technical talent, domain-specific expertise, and dedicated motivation of the DataRescue Boston community. We want to ensure that this community's experience and interests are represented in the DataRescue movement.</p> 
<p><img class="photo" src="{{ "/assets/photos/long-trail.jpg" | relative_url }}"/> As a part of the event, we had a breakout session with attendees, organizers, and members of EDGI responsible for coordinating the national DataRescue movement on how to improve DataRescue efforts and tools, what are the main goals and priorities of the movement, and what are the best ways to accomplish those? These discussions are ongoing, and we want you to be a part of them moving forward. To get involved:</p>
