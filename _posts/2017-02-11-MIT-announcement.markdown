DataRescue Boston at MIT event will now be held in **Walker Memorial (MIT Building 50) 142 Memorial St, Cambridge, MA 02139**. The amount of interest far exceeded our initial estimates, and we quickly outgrew our previous location. Fortunately, we were able to secure a new venue for the event!

This leads us to our second announcement: **Overflow ticket holders will now be guaranteed admittance!** Moving to the new venue has allowed us to host more people, so we are now able to honor all ticket holders: both regular registration and overflow registration. 

However, to make sure everyone has a comfortable experience at the event, **we are capping total registration to 260 attendees**. This means once the tickets are sold out, we unfortunately cannot accept any additional unregistered attendees.

We are extremely excited for this event, and cannot wait to see you all next weekend! Registered attendees will be receiving an email later this week with information on what to bring/install beforehand.
