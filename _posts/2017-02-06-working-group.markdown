We'll be hosting a weekly DataRescuers meeting at [MIT Building 5-233](http://whereis.mit.edu/?go=5) on Thursdays, 5-8pm for people to drop in and work on DataRescue efforts beyond the big events.

People will be seeding/sorting, harvesting data sets, developing tools, documenting efforts, researching new departments to rescue, organizing future events, and just hanging with other DataRescuers. Stop by and say hi!
